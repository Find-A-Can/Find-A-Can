# Find-A-Can

## Our Idea
There is so much trash in our cities and sometimes it’s hard to find a place to put your litter. We want to map all public garbage and recycling bins to make it easier to be a conscientious citizen. Sometimes it’s hard to find the nearest place to dispose of something, so it will help 
## Our Vision
We want to help people who want to make our cities cleaner. If it’s easier to find a trash bin for someone who doesn’t really want to litter, it would be less likely they litter. With no options, someone might just give up and drop their trash. Improperly handled trash hurts our local ecosystems. Our project is data driven and human powered. Our groundbreaking technology will allow citizens to help keep their neighborhoods clean and more easily dispose of waste in public.

While there exists an app that does this, it has some shortcomings we’d like to improve upon. It doesn’t differentiate garbage types, as recycling, compost, and garbage are all listed as the same thing. It also relies on unfiltered crowdsourced data, so it may not be very accurate in some locations.
