## What is Find A Can?

Find A Can lets you find nearby trash cans on your phone! It's so much easier to throw out things in the right place. Currently only supports the city of Seattle. 

## How to install 

Download the .apk file from releases to your phone **No release APK yet**  
Open the .apk on your phone. You will have a popup warning you about loading an unknown app. You will need to enable installation for just this app.  

This will eventually be replaced with a Google Play download link

## Running the App
Simply open the app like any other from your app drawer or home screen

## Using Find A Can

### Browse map
When you first open the app, you'll have a map of all sorts of pins. Each pin is a trash recepticle. Scroll around to look all over. Note that if you zoom too far out it will stop displaying pins. Press the re-center button in the top right to go to your location. 

### Find a specific type of can
Have a plastic bottle in your hand that you need to recycle but can't find the right can? Use the filter buttons on the bottom of the screen to only display certain types of cans. 

### Add a new can
Found a trash can we don't have on our map? Hit the "Add" button to add it to our database.  
**Known issues**
