## What is Find A Can?

Find A Can lets you find nearby trash cans on your phone! It's so much easier to throw out things in the right place. Currently only supports the city of Seattle. 

## How to install

## Using Find A Can

### Find a specific type of can
Have a plastic bottle in your hand that you need to recycle but can't find the right can? Use the filter buttons on the bottom of the screen to only display certain types of cans. 

### Add a new can
Found a trash can we don't have on our map? Hit the "Add" button to add it to our database.  
**Known issues**
