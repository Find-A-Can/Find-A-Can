## What is Find A Can?

Find A Can lets you find nearby trash cans on your phone! It's so much easier to throw out things in the right place. Currently only supports the city of Seattle. 

## How to install 

Download the .apk file from the latest release to your phone [https://github.com/Find-A-Can/Find-A-Can/releases](https://github.com/Find-A-Can/Find-A-Can/releases)  
Open the .apk on your phone.  
Android will ask you if you want to install the application  
Hit install and wait a few seconds

## Running the App

## Using Find A Can

### Browse map
When you first open the app, you'll have a map of all sorts of pins. Each pin is a trash recepticle. Scroll around to look all over. Note that if you zoom too far out it will stop displaying pins. Press the re-center button in the top right to go to your location. 

### Find a specific type of can
Have a plastic bottle in your hand that you need to recycle but can't find the right can? Use the filter buttons on the bottom of the screen to only display certain types of cans. 

Hit "CUSTOM" if you're looking for something specific, like a Garbage and Recycling can.  
Note that custom filters only look for exact matches. A filter for garbage and recycling will not match a can that is just garbage or just recycling.
